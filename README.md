# contentapi
The solution endeavours to save the content information and retrieve the content information. 
The application has been built using Node.js, Express and the database is MongoDB Atlas which is hosted on the Cloud.

The API returns the appropriate HTTP statuses and json responses when saving or retrieving data or if there is any error.
Error handling and comments have been added wherever required.
